### Template for DTR Memo

Project: Viewing_party

Group Member Names: Max Ribbans, Alex Osborne, James Fox-Collis

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?): 
```
Know we're successful when we know we want to keep working on the project, when we find ourselves in a good healthy work environment.  As a team we hope to achieve atleast 1 well implemented exploration.
```
	
Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):
```
Flexible schedules, agreed upon time constraints and desire to work as a team, and when able to go forward working solo.
```

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section):
```
Expect to have Saturday as blackout date, mornings to not work on project, and work times around dinner.  Cut off time 8:30 pm.
```

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?):
```
Continued communication through slack.
```

Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
```
Definitely want to improve in terms of API consumption.
```

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
```TBD
```

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques): 

Pomodoro Break Schedule:
```
Every 30-55 min depending on what we are tackling.
```

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
```
Specific, Actionable, and Kind.  Be open too, if I(we) are doing something that bothers you, lets communicate to work effectively as a team.
```


Additional Remote Considerations:
```
Ice Cream Sundays
```

Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools):
```
Utilizing a Github Project Board, and Github Organization.
```

Day 1 Agenda:

Additional Notes:

This DTR will be updated moving forward as we revisit the workload expectations and what we hope to accomplish.
